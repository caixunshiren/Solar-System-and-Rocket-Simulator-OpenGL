# Solar System and Rocket Simulator
This program demonstrates a 3D scaled model of our solar system based on real data and the Universal Law of Gravitation. Users could move, zoom in, zoom out, and rotate the map as well as toggle the time, space, and size scale of the solar system. Furthermore, users could launch rockets from their preferred planets, and the simulator will monitor and visualize the path and destinies of these rockets. In the end, users could modify the mass of the planets to see the effect of mass in the Universal Law of Gravitation.
